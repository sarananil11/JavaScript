1. Destructuring assignment is a feature in js that allows you to unpack the values from arrays or properties from objects into seperate variables.

2. used to seperate properties and elements.

3. You can use array destructuring to assign multiple variables at once from an array: 
	const [a, b] = [1, 2];

4. Object destructuring allows you to extract properties by name: 
	const {x, y} = {x: 10, y: 20};

5. You can set default values during destructuring: 
	const [a = 5, b = 10] = [1]; // a=1, b=10

6. Nested destructuring is possible for arrays and objects.

7. Destructuring can be used in function parameters to directly extract values.

8. Rest syntax (...) can be used with destructuring to collect remaining items.

9. Useful for swapping variables: 
	[a, b] = [b, a];
