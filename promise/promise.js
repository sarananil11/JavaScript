// A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

//     //asynchronous operation
// })



// resolve = called when operation is succesfull.
// reject = called when operation is failure.


// .then = executes if the promise is resolve.
// .catch = executes if the promise is reject.
// .finally = executes if the promise is either resolve or reject.
